# Mashup Fun

I want to build interesting applications to support Yacht maintenance activities.

## Target systems

The mashup would comprise functionality from 

1. Google Contancts -- for suppliers, owners and other interested parties
2. Google Calendar -- for record regular maintenance events, crusing periods, crew handovers, subscription renewals (and, as the ads say, "many many more"
3. Google Earth/Maps -- To show locations of vessel, ports and service providers
4. GitHUB -- key system for recording maintenance issues
5. Google Drive -- repository of documents of all kind -- searchable and web-accessible
6. CostSplit -- simple cash management for shared owners
7. GNUCash -- full account and financial management 

## Objectives

Create a workable and productive Yacht Maintenance system that is 

* Web accessible
* Supporting yacht owners and professional maintenance managers
* Accessible to suppliers
* Extensible to other maintenance activities -- e.g. Aircraft

## Prototypes

Prototype system have been developed to support my interests in Namadgi 3 owned by the [Canberra Ocean Racing Club](http://corc.com.au) and [Trilogy](https://www.sailblogs.com/member/trilogy)
